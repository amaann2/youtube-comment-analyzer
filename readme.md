# YouTube Comment Analysis

This project is a web application designed to analyze YouTube video comments. By simply providing a YouTube video URL and specifying the maximum number of comments to analyze, users can gain actionable insights into their audience's sentiments, detect spam, and uncover engagement trends.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand the audience's mood by categorizing comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Word Cloud**: Visualize the most frequently used words in the comments.
- **Most Engaging Comments**: Highlight the top comments that received the most engagement (likes and replies).
- **AI-Generated Replies**: Generate AI-powered responses to the most engaging comments, enabling creators to interact with their audience effectively.

## Future Enhancements

This project is still a work in progress. I am actively working on adding more features during my free time.
